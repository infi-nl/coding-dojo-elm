Basic Elm implementation of a QuizApp (using the [Infi Quiz API](http://infi-dojo-quizapi.azurewebsites.net/question/random)) to be used during the Infi Coding Dojo in October 2016.

## Development environment setup (using VS Code)

1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it yet. (Needed for _elm-repl_ to work.)
2. Install the [Elm Platform](https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html#install) (currently version 0.17.1).
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
4. Download Elm format (look for the download link in [this page](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#installation-)). Make sure you download the right version for the Elm Platform version that you installed (so at the moment [For Elm 0.17](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#for-elm-017)).  Currently the downloaded archive contains 1 executable (the Windows download anyway), called _elm-format.exe_. Make sure you place this executable in a folder that is in your PATH environment variable.

After downloading and installing these tools, when you open a command prompt, you should be able to invoke the commandline tools (like e.g. _elm-format_, _elm-repl_ and _elm-reactor_).

What remains now is setting up VS Code for Elm development. There are 2 plugins available for VS Code that help with Elm development:
- [elm](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sbrink.elm). Currently version 0.8.2. It can be installed by hitting Ctrl+P (Mac: Cmd+P) and typing "ext install elm". This plugin provides (amongst others) syntax and error highlighting, function information (hover over a function and get the signature) and autocompletion.
- [elm-format](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=abadi199.elm-format). Currently version 0.1.0. Install with Ctrl+P (Mac: Cmd+P) and "ext install elm-format". This plugin provides autoformatting of your code by hitting Ctrl+Shift+P (Mac: Cmd+Shift+P) and typing "elm format", or with the shortcut Shift+Alt+F.

Make sure you restart VS Code after installing the plugins.

When all this is done, you should see syntax highlighting when opening an Elm file (filename extension _.elm_), and formatting using Shift+Alt+F should work.

## Running elm

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. *Please note: due to a [bug](https://github.com/sbrink/vscode-elm/issues/75) in the [vscode-elm plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/sbrink.elm), error highlighting does not work in VS Code if there's a space in the folder structure that you clone the repository into.*
2. In your command line tool:
  - navigate to the directory coding-dojo-elm
  - run 'elm-make' and follow the instructions to install the necessary elm packages
  - run 'elm-reactor' to start a web server running your web application
3. Browse http://localhost:8000/static/index.html to see the result
4. If you see the text 'Infi Elm Quiz App' then you have done everything successfully!

## Assignment

The goal of this coding dojo is to build your own QuizApp web application with Elm, using the provided QuizApp API. More specifically:

1. Retrieve and display a question.
2. Display the possible answers.
3. Allow a user to select an answer, verify the answer and show the result.

Additional ideas:
- Keep score (e.g. how many questions seen total, how many correct answers and wrong answers given, ...).
- Display average time taken per question.
- Only allow a certain amount of time to answer a question.
- Use your imagination!
